I have implemented the WhatsApp case status updates feature as requested. Here's an overview of what I've created:

Lambda Function Structure:

index.js: Main Lambda handler that processes cases and sends notifications
config.js: Configuration file for various services and settings
schema.js: DynamoDB table schema definition
utils.js: Utility functions for database, notifications, and message formatting
package.json: Dependencies and project metadata
README.md: Setup and deployment instructions
Key Features:

Periodic case status checks (every 6 hours)
Batch processing to handle many cases efficiently
WhatsApp notifications using Twilio
DynamoDB for storing case tracking information
Error handling and retry mechanisms
Detailed logging and monitoring
System Flow:

Lambda function triggers every 6 hours
Fetches all tracked cases from DynamoDB
Initializes eCourts API session
Processes cases in batches
Sends WhatsApp notifications for status changes
Updates case status in DynamoDB
Logs statistics and results
Environment Variables Required:

AWS_REGION
DYNAMODB_TABLE
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN
TWILIO_WHATSAPP_NUMBER
ECOURTS_API_URL
To deploy this:

Create a DynamoDB table using the schema provided
Set up AWS Lambda with the environment variables
Configure EventBridge to trigger the Lambda every 6 hours
Set up Twilio WhatsApp integration
Deploy the code to AWS Lambda
The Lambda function is designed to be scalable and maintainable, with proper error handling and monitoring capabilities. You can track its performance and any issues through CloudWatch logs and metrics.

Would you like me to explain any specific part in more detail or help with the deployment process?
